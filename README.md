# MTFormer
Official PyTorch implementation of MTFormer for agricultural parcel segmentation.


Dataset: Multi-Regional Agricultural Parcels (MR-AP)
The Multi-Regional Agricultural Parcels (MR-AP) is a comprehensive benchmark dataset covering 7 typical agricultural regions across China. To ensure the highest annotation quality, the agricultural parcel (AP) masks in the MR-AP dataset were meticulously annotated by hand using multi-source high-resolution imagery, including Gaofen-1 (GF-1), Gaofen-2 (GF-2), Gaofen-7 (GF-7), Ziyuan-1 02D (ZY01-D), and Google Earth.
